node.exe : [@sentry/nextjs] WARNING: You are using the Sentry SDK with `next build --turbo`. The Sentry SDK doesn't yet
 fully support Turbopack. The SDK will not be loaded in the browser, and serverside instrumentation will be inaccurate 
or incomplete. If you are just trying out Sentry or attempting to configure the SDK, we recommend temporarily removing 
the `--turbo` flag while you are developing locally. Follow this issue for progress on Sentry + Turbopack: https://gith

NING=1 as environment variable)

 To silence this warning, set `turbopack.root` in your Next.js config, or consider removing one of the lockfiles if it'
s not needed.
